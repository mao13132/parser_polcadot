During its time, it provided a valuable service to validators and Parity engineers alike, that ensured reliability of our network.\nThere is a new mechanism, Warp Sync, that makes this service redundant, therefore we stopped making new snapshots in April 2023. We are seeking the reimbursment of Google Cloud expenses for the Jan-Apr period as well as the deposit for the Gov1 Proposal replaced by this. The total is 3,936.69 DOT.\nAll details can be found in the proposal page:\nhttps://hackmd.io/@nicolasochem/B19RK5lmh\nThank you very much for your consideration",
